## objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end data pipeline and predictive analytics system that identifies diabetes patients at high risk of hospital readmission. 
By leveraging structured healthcare data, machine learning models, and interactive visualizations, the system aims to assist healthcare providers in proactively managing patient outcomes, 
optimizing treatment strategies, and reducing the likelihood of preventable readmissions
